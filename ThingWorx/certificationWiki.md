### Properties

Properties are the attributes (i.e. speed, location, firmware version, temperature, etc) of an specific entity (Thing, ThingTemplate or ThingShape). It is the same as attributes of a class in Object Oriented Programming.  

* How you describe the data directly related to a Thing
  - The Thingâ€™s current conditions  
  - Static or dynamic aspects  
  - Example: Serial No. (static), Current Temperature (dynamic)  

* Defined at Thing, ThingTemplate, or ThingShape level  
  - Properties are inherited from implemented ThingTemplates and ThingShapes

* Each property has a name, description, and base type.  
  - Depending on the base type, a property may contain different kinds of information
  - Example: a base type InfoTable can hold a table of values described by a DataShape
